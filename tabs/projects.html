Using visual signatures (brightness, hue, etc.) as the feature space, SVM models were successful in distinguishing aggregated land cover classes.

Overall, generally, humans are successful in agreeing upon Developed, Forested, and Water landscapes, and are poor in agreeing upon landscapes dominated by Shrubs or Grassland. When using citizen science, making the task as objective as possible is critical for reliable and consistent responses.
